Drupal module to create a taxonomy tagged text field
====

This module adds a new field to Drupal 7.23+ that pairs a configurable taxonomy to a text field.

It can be used to do things like add a justification, or note to why a taxonomy was chosen, or a flag to the text field.

This is very much a work in progress. Really needs views integration for filtering to be realy useful.
